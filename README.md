Semester project in the Agent Based Modeling and Social System Simulation course at ETHZ, Autumn semester 2019.

> * Group Name: Vacci-nation
> * Group participants names: Antunes Morgado Nicolas G., Gundersen Benjamin, HÃ¼hnerbein Jannes, Siebenaller Julius
> * Project Title: (can be changed later)

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

What is the relationship between social attitudes with respect to vaccination and the dynamics of epidemic episodes?
What is the influence of health policy in social planner games in relation to the laissez faire results?

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
