- Dividing the population into different groups,  including pro-/ anti-vaccinators and maybe even a few that canâ€™t vaccinate during a specific period (too young, ill, etc.)
- Including (besides Nash equilibrium) Stackelberg equilibrium and a social planner perspective
Maybe we can combine a few of the above features with:
- social learning/ adaptive behaviour
- Vaccine efficiency and risk aversion
- Social Planner: Penalties for not-vaccinating and re-distribution of these incomes

Notes on disease-modeling (type of disease, mathematical model, network, etc.): // as found in the literature
- SIR reaction-diffusion model: Smallpox, mumps (Sun et al. (2016) and included references) 
- Diseases with spatial-temporal patterns: measles, hantavirus, influenza, chronic hepatitis C (Sun et al. (2016))
- Seasonality and noise: e.g. childhood diseases (varying contact rate, e.g. school terms), influenza, RSV, rotavirus, varicella (Acedo et al. 2016) 
- Multiscale oscillations in patterns of incidence characteristics driven by social learning: childhood diseases, rotavirus, camplyobacter, cancers (Keane (2016))
- SEIR-model: measles, flu, pox, dengue (Upadhyay et al. (2019))
