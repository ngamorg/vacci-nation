- Ability of an individual to reduce susceptibility to the infection: reduction of contacts and of transmission probability
- Model of infectious dynamics combines (1) disease transmission dynamics and (2) imitation dynamics, with different time scales
- SIR-model, but with infectious as symptomatic/ asymptomatic and similar for recovered; S&I adpot normal or altered (reduction of infectious contacts) behavior
- Perceived prevalence modeled according to symptomatic cases over a certain period with fading memory
[8] Sun et al. (2016) - Pattern transitions in spatial epidemics: Mechanisms and emergent properties
- Spatial dependency of epidemic spread: non-negligible, leads to richer static solutions and dynamic behavior in comparison with time only dependent models (i.e. characterized by the reproduction number)
- Individual agent states and transitions: analogous to time only dependent "compartmental" models (SI/SIS/SIR/SIRS/SEIRS)
- Stationary (steady state) and spatio-temporal (transient, sustained) patterns arise in Reaction-Diffusion PDE and CA (main parameters: force of infection / contact rate B, infection period tau_I, recovery period tau_r, death rate d, noise terms eta_i)
- Main mechanisms responsible for pattern transitions: seasonal forcing (sinusoidal B), spatial heterogeneity and demographic/environmental stochasticity.
- Behavioral response: affects epidemic spread mainly through vaccination and intermitent social distancing (both of them depend in turn on disease awareness). Warning: models become complex and difficult to validate.
[9] Keane (2016) - Chaos in collective health: Fractal dynamics of social learning
- Social learning game: Individuals adopt highest payoff strategies from their neighbourhood (self included; lattice, small world, etc.)
- Individual earns benefit from own health and from amount of healthy neighbors
- Can prevent spread of disease by protectice action at cost c times amount of neighbors against whom to protect
- Social norm compliance in form of cost reduction if both neighbors play protection strategy
- SIRS-model and evolutionary spatial game
- Findings: self-similarity coefficient closely corresponds to the level of protection <-> protecting collectives form when spreading disease is present locally
[10] Bhattacharyya, Bauch (2012) - Evolutionary Game Theory and Social Learning Can Determine How Vaccine Scares Unfold
- Behavioral model based on a single strategy ("vaccinator" or "not vaccinator") coupled to a SIR compartmental model to capture disease transmision, fitted against historical data from the UK's whole cell pertursis and measles–mumps–rubella vaccine scares of the 1970s and 1990s, respectively
- Main behavioral parameters: ratio of penalty to vaccinate to the product of the penalty of infection times perceived probability of being infected (omega), number of case notifications or incidence (L or I). A time-dependent omega captures social learning (higher values during vaccine scare) and notifications/incidence captures feedback (higher incidence leads to higher vaccination)
[11] Bauch, Earn (2004) - Vaccination and the theory of games
- Game-theoretic analysis of the (binary) vaccination strategy coupled to a SIR compartmental model to capture probability of infection (pi_p)
- Maximization of expected payoff guaranteed by switching/not switching to the opposite strategy, depending on the sign of DeltaE = E_vacc - E_not_vacc
- Main parameters: relative risk of vaccination to infection (r), probability of getting infected for a given vaccination coverage p (pi_p), reproductive ratio (R_0)
- Main result: if R_0 > 1, for any r > 0 ==> P(vacc) < P_critical for erradication ("free riding" of unvaccinated individuals on the vaccinated population)
