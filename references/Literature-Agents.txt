  - Payoff determined by perceived risk: cost of infection and prevalence of cases

- Ability of an individual to reduce susceptibility to the infection: reduction of contacts and of transmission probability
- Model of infectious dynamics combines (1) disease transmission dynamics and (2) imitation dynamics, with different time scales
- SIR-model, but with infectious as symptomatic/ asymptomatic and similar for recovered; S&I adpot normal or altered (reduction of infectious contacts) behavior
- Perceived prevalence modeled according to symptomatic cases over a certain period with fading memory
[8] Sun et al. (2016) - Pattern transitions in spatial epidemics: Mechanisms and emergent properties
- Spatial dependency of epidemic spread: non-negligible, leads to richer static solutions and dynamic behavior in comparison with time only dependent models (i.e. characterized by the reproduction number)
- Individual agent states and transitions: analogous to time only dependent models (SI/SIS/SIR/SIRS/SEIRS)
- Stationary (steady state) and spatio-temporal (transient, sustained) patterns arise in Reaction-Diffusion PDE and CA (main parameters: force of infection / contact rate B, infection period tau_I, recovery period tau_r, death rate d, noise terms eta_i)
- Main mechanisms responsible for pattern transitions: seasonality (sinusoidal B), spatial heterogenity and demographic/environmental stochasticity.
- Behavioral response: affects epidemic spread mainly through vaccination and intermitent social distancing (both of them depend in turn on disease awareness). Warning: models become complex and difficult to validate.
