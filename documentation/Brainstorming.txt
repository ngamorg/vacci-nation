- Dividing the population into different groups,  including pro-/ anti-vaccinators and maybe even a few that canâ€™t vaccinate during a specific period (too young, ill, etc.)

- Vaccine efficiency and risk aversion
- Social Planner: Penalties for not-vaccinating and re-distribution of these incomes
